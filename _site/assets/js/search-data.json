    "content": "As you learned during the lectures of Tectonic Geomorphology, the topography of the earth surface experiences changes and modifications when the base level of erosion is modified. These changes are related either to climatic or tectonic forcing. In fact, when the topography of a given area is subject to forcing, rivers are no longer in equilibrium. As a consequence, rivers will adjust their profile by regressive erosion, but also the morphology of the entire river catchment area. The aim of the research project is to highlight the geomorphologic activity influencing the topography of selected river catchments in Belgium, on the basis of a geomorphometric analysis. The main data available for this analysis is a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resampled from LiDAR data. ",

In practice, it means that the range of values contained in the datasets is stretched over the black to white gradient. If the distribution of these values is not relatively constant over the entire range, e.g. the majority of values is less than 1000 while only a few pixels have very large values (e.g. &gt; 10^6), the GIS will render a completely black layer. This might be caused by a mis-interpretation of no data values in digital elevation models. It is also typical for flow accumulation data (few large values in rivers while majority of hillslopes have low values). To properly render such raster datasets, the idea is to ask QGIS to render values only on the currently visible range of pixel values.

One mandatory analysis for the research project is to compute hypsometric curves. However, any other relevant analysis is welcome ! Be imaginative… . Hypsometric curves . Following Strahler (1952), the hypsometric curve relates horizontal cross-sectional area of a drainage basin to relative elevation above basin mouth. As both parameters (in x and y) are dimensionless, curves can be described and compared irrespective of basin size or shape. In other words, it describes the relative proportion of the watershed area that lies at or above a given height relative to the total relief of the watershed (Luo, 1998). Differences in the shape of the curve are related to the degree of disequilibrium in the balance of erosive and tectonic forces (Weissel and Pratson, 1994). References . | Luo, W. (1998).

    "content": "The client-server model and the Pelican server . The software is more efficiently and easier to use when deployed on a remote Linux server. A server is a piece of computer hardware that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called clients. This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called “services”, such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers. The server that we will use during the practical sessions is the “Pelican” server, which is part of the CISM (Center for High Performance Computing and Mass Storage) of the UCLouvain. The Pelican server will allow you to run LSDTopotools, but also provides Nextcloud and JupyterHub services. Nextcloud is an open-source file hosting service (similar to Dropbox, OneDrive,…). JupyterHub is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. SSH protocol and client . The connection between the client (you) and the server is done via the internet, which is an open and unsecured network by definition. In order to access the server in a secure way, all the transactions between the client and the server are done using a cryptographic network protocol, i.e. the Secure Shell (SSH). SSH refers both to the cryptographic network protocol and to the suite of utilities that implement that protocol. SSH uses the client-server model, connecting a Secure Shell client application, which is the end where the session is displayed, with an SSH server, which is the end where the session runs. SSH clients are softwares which enable the user to connect to the server using the SSH protocol. Depending on the OS on which your machine is running, several SSH clients are possible. | On Windows: MobaXterm. | On Mac and Linux: Termius (also run on Windows but the free version has limited possibilities for file transfer). | .

Both passwords are the password of your CISM account. In a linux terminal, the cursor on screen will not move, and there is no indicator the password is being entered at all. This is intentional and serves as a security mechanism, unlike entering a password into a web form or a standard GUI login screen, which is typically masked as asterisks or bullets. The reason is rather simple, it provides no indication for how long a password is, offering some further obfuscation to password entry. | If your terminal display a lot of “strange” information, i.e. the server specifications, but also a pelican drawing, it means that you are now connected to the Pelican server. You can then interact with the server by typing your first command, e.g. pwd. | . The MobaXterm window has two panels. The left (white) panel has several tabs in the vertical axis. The SFTP tab is the file browser on the server. It allows you to create files and folders on the server, as well as upload and download files from and to the server. The Sessions tab contains the different saved sessions. The right (black) panel is the terminal, which allows you to can interact with the server using command lines. On Mac / Linux . | Open Terminus and select “Settings”. | On the left panel, select “SSH” and then “Add connection”. | Create a connection to the gateway using the following parameters: . | Setting | Value | . | Name | gateway | . | Group | cism | . | Host | gwcism.cism.ucl.ac.be | . | Port | 22 (already there) | . | Username | MY_LOGIN (CISM) | . | Authentication | Password | . | Click “Save”. | Create a second connection to the Pelican server using the following parameters: . | Setting | Value | . | Name | pelican | . | Group | cism | . | Host | pelican.cism.ucl.ac.be | . | Port | 22 (already there) | . | Username | MY_LOGIN (CISM) | . | Authentication | Password | . | In the “Advanced” tab, define the following parameters: . | Setting | Value | . | Jump host | gateway | . | Agent forwarding | Activate the slider | . | Click “Save”. | . Now, the SSH connection (via the gateway) is set up and you can connect to the Pelican server. To do that: . | Click on the “world” icon on the right side of the menu bar. | Select the “cism / pelican” connexion. Not the gateway. | Enter your CISM password two times, i.e. once for the gateway and once for the server itself. | . ",

You can install a desktop client via the website of Nextcloud. During the practical sessions, Nextcloud can be used as a way to transfer files from your PC to the server and vice-versa. It will be used by Mac and Linux users. For those on Windows who are using MobaXterm, it is not a necessary step, as MobaXterm provides an integrated SFTP interface. To connect an external storage, i.e. your home folder on the Pelican server, follow these steps: . | Go to the settings of Nextcloud via the web interface, i.e. click on the icon on the upper-right corner of the screen (with the first letter of your firstname) and choose “Settings”. | Choose “External storages” on the left panel. | Add a new external storage using the following settings: . | Setting | Value | . | Folder name | Pelican | . | Add storage | SFTP | . | Authentication | Username and password | . | Host | pelican.cism.ucl.ac.be | . | Root | /home/elic/MY_LOGIN | . | Username | MY_LOGIN (CISM) | . | Password | MY_PASSWORD (CISM) | . | Click on the “v”.
